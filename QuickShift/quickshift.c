@section quickshift-intro Overview

Quick shift [1] is a fast mode seeking algorithm, similar to mean
shift. The algorithm segments a color image (or any image with more
than one component) by identifying clusters of pixels in the joint
spatial and color dimensions. Segments are local (superpixels) and can
be used as a basis for further processing.

Given an image, the algorithm calculates a forest of pixels whose
branches are labeled with a distance value
(::vl_quickshift_get_parents, ::vl_quickshift_get_dists). This
specifies a hierarch
