@section quickshift-intro Overview

Quick shift [1] is a fast mode seeking algorithm, similar to mean
shift. The algorithm segments a color image (or any image with more
than one component) by identifying clusters of pixels in the joint
spatial and color dimensions. Segments are local (superpixels) and can
be used as a basis for further processing.

Given an image, the algorithm calculates a forest of pixels whose
branches are labeled with a distance value
(::vl_quickshift_get_parents, ::vl_quickshift_get_dists). This
specifies a hierarchical segmentation of the image, with segments
corresponding to subtrees. Useful superpixels can be identified by
cutting the branches whose distance label is above a given threshold
(the threshold can be either fixed by hand, or determined by cross
validation).

Parameter influencing the algorithm are:

- <b>Kernel size.</b> The pixel density and its modes are
estimated by using a Parzen window estimator with a Gaussian kernel of
the specified size (::vl_quickshift_set_kernel_size). The larger the
size, the larger the neighborhoods of pixels considered.
- <b>Maximum distance.</b> This (::vl_quickshift_
